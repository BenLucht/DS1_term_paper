The objective of this term paper is to provide an overview of clustering by the example of four different clustering algorithms applied to four different data sets. The algorithms used are K-Means, Mean Shift, Affinity Propagation, and Spectral Clustering. These provide different characteristics concerning e.g. metrics, handling of data set sizes and evenness of cluster size as well as the parameters driving them. Data sets on house pricing, mall customers, wheat seeds and red wine show vastly different properties in relation to the number of observations and features along with types of features, to exhibit the differences in clustering results for the algorithms used. Visualization of results and comparisons can be accessed through an online frontend.
