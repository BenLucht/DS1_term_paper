\subsection{Mall Customer Segmentation}
\textit{by J. M.}\\

The Data Set Mall Customer Segmentation Data includes basic customer data. It contains a unique Id for each customer, gender, age, the annual income, and the spending Score. In this Score you can have a value between 1 and 100. The distribution of gender of the customer is 56\% female and 44 \% male. In the preprocessing every entry of the gender column gets a number 0 or 1 depending on the gender is male or female. I do this because than every entry of this dataset contains only numbers. The Age of the Customers is between 18 und 70. The Annual Income of the customers is between 15 and 127.
